        <p>In this, I want to show a brand new opening-week sale offer for our traditional
        tea, and show when it expires.
        </p>
        <p>I plan to do this by creating an object for the traditional tea, 
        calculating an offer, a small explanation of the deal, and in how many days the
        offer expires.!</p> -->

        <h2>Granding opening offer!</h2>
        <p id="tea"></p>
        <p id="price">Old &amp; new price will display here.</p>
        <p id="time-remaining">A note showing when the offers expired will display here, and
        an offer valid date range!</p>
        <p><strong>We hope to see you soon :)</strong></p>
