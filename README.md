WAH *HAH*! ~~MY DELICIOUS PILE OF PROGRAMS~~

Bite-sized programs in Javascript that I'm creating as I learn that usually end up food-related.

**Book used:** *Javascript & JQuery* by Jon Duckett

### A quick explanation on lack of ES6...or lets...or even ES5. You know, I'm not even sure:
In tech years, this book is old, and apparently a lot of new stuff has happened to Javascript.

Yes, *'apparently'*. Because, quite frankly, I'm not even sure how wrinkly and bald my code is. LOL. I will later and cringe, but, for now, I'm throwing caution to the wind for the sake of progress.

I'm contrarily too new to programming to be able to do anything other than what the book tells me. And me likeys de book.

Ahh, alas. I will understand the hip slang of the language soon enough.

eatMeJS is me getting le programming basics down through JavaScript since being a wizard web dev sounds pretty fun.

Enjoy! Don't get too hungry.
